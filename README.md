Don’t you hate it when your friend’s food looks tastier than yours? AR Menu uses augmented reality technology to showcase a restaurant's menu as realistic 3D food models before it comes to your plate- so you know exactly what you had ordered. This android experiment replaces old, out-dated paper menus to an interactive and cool way to dine.
